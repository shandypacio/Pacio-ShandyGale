**Brief Description of the Portfolio**
This Portfolio of mine showcases my programming journey as a third-year college student taking Bachelor of Science in Information Systems at the Technological University of the Philippines.
It consists an overview of my skills, projects, and aspirations as I aim to become a proficient back-end and front-end developer.
I came up with visually engaging design, with a friendly header, an overview section, and a footer that includes connections to my social media accounts for convenient access.

**Instructions on How to Clone the Repository and Run the site using VSCode Live Server**
I added a repository by opening the Github website and then adding it to File Explorer. Following those actions, I open VS Code a second time, putting my cursor to a file and opening the "Pacio-ShandyGale" folder.
I completed the coding immediately after, and since I had already downloaded Live Server, all I needed to do to run the site is by clicking the "Go Live" button in the lower right corner. I then push it after committing my edits or modifications.
