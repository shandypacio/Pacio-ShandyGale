                <h4> &#x1F539; C Programming Language: Game Project | Flappy</h4>
                <p>It is an imitation of the popular cellphone application called Flappy Bird. Applied the concepts of Loop Functions and Struct.</p>

                <h4> &#x1F539; C++ Programming Language: File Compression</h4>
                <p>This C++ program implements Huffman Coding, a compression algorithm used to reduce the size of data by encoding characters based on their frequency of occurrence.</p>

                <h4> &#x1F539; C++ Programming Language: File Decompression</h4>
                <p>This C++ program represents the Huffman Coding system's decompression stage. Its functions include reading a compressed file, decoding the compressed message, 
                    reconstructing the Huffman Tree from a stored file, and saving the decompressed message into an output file.
